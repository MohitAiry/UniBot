Prof. & Head  
Department of Industrial & Production Engineering

College of Technology, G.B.Pant University Agriculture & Technology, Pantnagar offered Production Engineering program at the Bachelor’s levels since July 1984 to May 2013. On May 8th, 2013 Department of Industrial & Production Engineering (formerly production engineering) was established with revised courses & addition of new course in UG Program. The curriculum revolves around imparting knowledge of planning, measuring and controlling all activities within the organization, besides designing the production process for a product. The department blends advanced theory and practices required for the development and management of modern industry. The department is rich in resources, including laboratories necessary for the development and nourishment of skills necessary for an engineer working in industrial scenarios. We earnestly emphasize on a healthy and intimate teacher- student relationship so that the true potential of each student is realized and flourished. The department of IPE aims not only to produce efficient engineers, but also well educated conscientious leaders who can contribute to the development of the country through ameliorating our industries. The Department feels proud of achievements of its alumni, who have excelled in various walks of life.
