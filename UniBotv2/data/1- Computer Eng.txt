**Dr. S. D. Samantaray**  
Prof. & Head  
Department of Computer Engineering

The B.Tech (Computer Engineering) Programme was started in 1984 in the erstwhile department of Electrical Engineering. The separate Department of Computer Engineering came into existence in 1993. existence through the trifurcation of the Electrical Engineering department. The Department of Computer Engineering, College of Technology offers two programmes viz. B.Tech. (Computer Engineering) and M.Tech. (Computer Engineering). Ever since it’s inception the department has set high standards for itself. Both the faculty members and students continuously strive to achieve the set objectives. The faculty with its experienced, sincere and hard working members has been a constant source of inspiration and encouragement to the students. The Curriculum is modified on a regular basis to meet the requirements and expectations of industry. Adequate emphasis has been given on improving the innovation, creativity, practical knowledge and programming skills.

#### **Degree Program Offered**
